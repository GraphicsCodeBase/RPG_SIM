===============================================
Game name
=========
letting go.

its a love romance game about my time in y1 trimester2.


The story starts off as a kid in highschool who find a friend slowly gets closer to them

,the closer and closer he gets to know this friend the more mysteries he finds in this person. as well as his attraction.
eventually. 


type of game this is. 
this is an RPG maker similar to undertale. 
where each hurdle, the player has to play a mini game.(each mini game dipicts a struggle the protag has faced.) be it doubt, anxiety, rejection. These come at various points in the game. 


how to play the game, player would have to do a series of quests (this is to get the attention of the friend)

by completing all the way to the end of the quest will have the player write a confession letter to her which she will end up rejecting the player.


this would be like undertale where there will be scenes and txt. box. maybe art for the player in 8 bit.?
